One thing I know for sure is that I want new characters to basically be given a house instantly
I’m going to make a huge housing district
Probably with different districts, different house sizes, all connected via the train system.

# Old Document Dump
This tutorial walks the player through the commands to use in order to customize their house.
Walkthrough
Upon starting the tutorial, the initiating PC is teleported to their house, and they are joined by NPC, the NPC who will be their instructor.
NPC gives a brief overview of the commands the player is about to learn, and why they would want to.
NPC materializes in front of PC, an inviting smile on his face. “Hello there, PC! My name is NPC, and I am here to teach you how to customize your home. We will be going over a few different commands, all of which will allow you to customize the Title, Description, and other aspects of your home. Let me know when you are ready to get started by saying, ‘I’m ready!’”
“I can’t wait to see what you do with the place,” he exclaims, shaking with anticipation.
NPC details how to change the title of the current room.
“Awesome! First, let’s go over how to change the Title of this room we are in now. You can set the room’s title to anything you want, as long as it is within # characters. Keep in mind, this room title could be seen by other players, so let’s keep it clean!"
“The room’s current Title is Title. When you are ready to change the Title, type the following command, replacing the title with the one you have chosen:”
“`/phome title Title`”
“Remember to replace Title with your chosen name! Feel free to change it a few times if you’d like. Just let me know when you are ready to move on by saying something along the lines of, ‘Let’s change the description now!’”
NPC details how to change the description of the current room.
“Hey PC, this room is really shaping up.” NPC inspects the room, holding one hand to his chin as if in deep thought. “It is a little boring though, isn’t it? Let’s fix that now! You can modify the description of the room by using the following command, replacing the description with whatever you choose:”
“`/phome desc Desc`”
“Just like we did with the Title, feel free to change the description a few times, and let me know when you are ready to move on.”
NPC informs the player that it is possible to lock/unlock their home, and how they can change the setting for that.
NPC spins in place, admiring the decor of the room, pure elation on his face. “Yes! Perfect! I absolutely love what you’ve done with the place, PC. I did have some potentially bad news though, unfortunately.”
NPC leans in toward PC, and whispers softly, “Not everyone in this world is good.” He shrugs while straightening back up. “I’d hate to see all of this work go to waste. Not to worry though! You can just lock the door, and never let them in.” He steps toward the door, motioning for PC to look at the keypad above the door knob.
“You can lock the door with a four (4) digit pin of your choice. I am going to provide the command, but please don’t try it until I say, OK?” NPC holds both hands together in front of him, begging you to heed his words. “The command you will use is as follows:”
“`/phome lock direction [pin] [pin]`”
“If you want to lock the door using the previously chosen pin, you can use:”
“`/phome lock direction`”
“To unlock a door you have previously locked, you can use:”
“`/phome unlock pin`”
“Finally, if you wish to remove the lock and pin from a room exit entirely, you can use:”
“`/phome unpin direction pin`”
“Now that all of that is out of the way, go ahead and play with those commands for a moment. If you get stuck, you can ask me to repeat myself, or reset the locks." NPC steps to the side, giving PC some space to play with the keypad, maintaining a watchful eye.
"I'll be right here, so just let me know when you are ready to learn more about what other options are available to you."
(Placeholder for other options.)
NPC tells the player how to end the tutorial, and teleports them back to where they were when prompted.
NPC smiles to PC, and looks around the room, admiring their work. “I must say, PC, you’ve done a great job here. When you are ready to return to the game, just tell me you are ready to go back.”
