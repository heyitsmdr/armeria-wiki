One thing I know for sure is that I want new characters to basically be given a house instantly
I’m going to make a huge housing district
Probably with different districts, different house sizes, all connected via the train system.
I also want to start thinking about the story a bit.
I really like the idea of magic being a “hidden” thing in the world at least from the perspective of your character and how you just start in a modern city on probably Earth.
But there will be so many other worlds/planets out there. Just need to think of ways to expose that and access that in a clever way
