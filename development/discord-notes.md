# New  Character Experience
**MDR**
I’m liking it more and more honestly. And I just had a thought in my head that maybe as a new character, you start off as an employee of Armeria Industries.
Maybe you get assigned / can pick a job or something. You can eventually quit if you want to join another corp somewhere. It could have a huge office with some restricted areas so there is secrecy

**Abel**
I was thinking fairly early on, the player is approached by a shady character to offer alternatives that aren't as uhh
above board lol

**MDR**
Yeah I like that.
I want Armeria Industries to basically be a mega-corp in the world. They try to control everything.
So breaking free from that and offering "ways out".. I like that.

**Abel**
It could really just be a spot where quest lines split, and if you get so far down one, it blocks the other (sorry lol)

**MDR**
Yeah. Perhaps we make "Reputation" a thing. And if you go too far one way, you lose a ton of rep with Armeria Industries and it would take a long time to gain that back.

**Abel**
I like it. What activities could regain rep? How long would you have to do said activity to get 'enough' rep back?
# Remember / Emote System
Oh man. I really like how this mud does emotes.
You can insert your own name with `/self`, or someone else in the room with `/<name>` or `/<short desc if you dont know their name>`
And you do `/remember <short-desc> as <whatever>` then you can target them in your emotes with the name you choose
And the name you choose persists everywhere. In the room list, examine, all of it
So someone can tell you their name is one thing, and it be a fake name. You could never find out.
# Client Ideas
**MDR** - I also had an idea where when you run a command and it returns a table, it appears on the right side of the text area in a fixed way.

# Mini-Games
That could be like an entire mini-game aspect of Armeria too. Maybe we just start there. Like an entire section of the world can have all of these types of games.
Talk to an NPC of a certain game type and you get teleported into the area of that game, etc.

# Spells
**MDR** - So I think for spells, they will be spoken phrases (using /say) that relate to a particular spell. I’m not sure if you’ve played Tibia (the 2D game) but they do that and I really liked that idea.

# Arcadia Power Station
**MDR** - This morning on the train I was thinking the main city that all players start in (which I was thinking might be called Arcadia), I was thinking a small area of it would be like a power station with power lines and whatnot, with underground tunnels with some mobs in it and maybe a quest over there.


# Cartography
Player made maps. etc etc

# ARG
**A** - In the future, I like the idea of running a small arg to unlock a new area. Solve the clues to discover the portals location etc

# Original Idea
**MDR** - My original idea was that there wasn’t much emphasis on the overarching story but more so that individual areas have their own quest lines and their own unique stories that are unique and isolated to that area. Kinda like Aardwolf.

# Help Files
Track nonexistent help files to determine what files we should make, or make an alias of another file.

# Character Creation Talk
**Abel**
How detailed do you want to get with stats on a character?
**mdr**
Pretty detailed.
Probably somewhere between basic and very advanced. Like I want a lot of room for customization but not something overwhelming
**Abel**
I know accessibility is a concern, so we can also setup some templates and ask the player if they want a quick chargen or detailed chargen
**mdr**
Yeah
I like that.
**Abel**
It'll do stat alloc for them and all that. Also lets people get in game quick without being overwhelming. Maybe have a grace period where we can send them back to chargen to adjust it
**mdr**
Maybe it would be a part of this tutorial area that you can teleport to.
You can talk to a stat NPC or something.
**Abel**
As long as we remove access after a certain point yeah
Whether that is time, exp, whatever
**mdr**
Oh yeah, for sure. Even if it’s just the corridor in the tutorial area that gets blocked off
**Abel**
I like the idea of an NPC. Tell them to eff off if they are too old or something haha
**mdr**
haha yeah
