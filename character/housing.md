# Housing

Everyone has an equal opportunity to become a home owner! On [Aluxium](/world/planets/aluxium), within [Arcadia City](/world/planets/aluxium/arcadia), you can travel to the **Housing District**. From there, you can visit other home owners as well as secure a piece of land yourself and design your dream home.

## Housing District

The **Housing District** of Arcadia City is very large. It could even be considered a city within a city. There are five isolated boroughs with each borough acting as an island surrounded by water.

The five boroughs are connected to one another by an underground tram system.

## Mortgage

To become a home owner, you **do not** need to pay for an expensive house upfront. Much like the real world, you can take out a mortgage.

To secure a home mortgage, you simply need to be employed. A single, empty plot of land will require a mortgage of **$10,000**. Regardless of your job and salary, the **Arcadia Housing Association (AHA)** will deduct 10% from each paycheck automatically until the loan is paid off.

### House Expansions

Assuming you don't just want a single plot of land with nothing on it, you will likely want to build and expand on your plot shortly after receiving it from the Arcadia Housing Association.

You can start by adding rooms to your plot at the rate of **$100 / room**, if paid upfront. Alternatively, you can pay an extra **50%** (ie: $150) and tack it onto your mortgage loan.

The base rate for additional rooms will increase as you expand your home. You can continue to either pay upfront ***or*** append the expenses to your mortgage.

| Rooms   | Upfront Cost                   | Mortgage Cost        |
| ------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| 0 - 10  | $100 / room                    | $150 / room (+50%)   |
| 11 - 20 | $200 / room                    | $300 / room (+50%)   |
| 21 - 30 | $300 / room                    | $450 / room (+50%)   |
| 31 - 40 | $500 / room                    | $1000 / room (+100%) |
| 41 - 50 | $1000 / room                   | Not Available        |
| 51+     | $1000 / room (+ Mortgage Paid) | Not Available        |

Note that you **cannot** build beyond 51 rooms without the mortgage being paid in full.

### Unemployed

Should you happen to lose your job, you will lose access to your own home. Furthermore, the entire home will be locked out to anyone else who had previously been given access. Once you secure a new job, access will immediately be re-instated.
