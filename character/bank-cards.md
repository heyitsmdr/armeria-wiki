# Bank Cards

**Bank Cards** are debit cards that your character has access to. Every character in Armeria will start with one. They store all of the money that your character has access to.

## Lost Cards

If you don't have access to any bank cards, you can request a new card for free from any Bank Teller.

## Duplicate Cards

Bank cards can be duplicated for a fee from a Bank Teller. These can be given out to friends, family, or whoever you want to be able to access your money.

### Spending Limits

When creating a duplicate bank card to give out, you can set spending limits.

## Transaction Log

All bank cards maintain a permanent transaction log. This includes money being added or removed from the card. Furthermore, all duplicate cards share the same transaction log.

### Notifications

If you have bank transaction notifications enabled (by default, it is), you will see all transactions across all cards and duplicate cards that your character has access to.

## Credit

You can access a line of credit via [Credit Cards](/character/credit-cards).
