# Credit Cards

**Credit Cards** have the same functionality as [Bank Cards](/character/bank-cards). Once your character reaches a certain age, you can apply for a Credit Card from any Bank Teller.

Unlike [Bank Cards](/character/bank-cards), you will have access to a line of credit which you can use for any in-game purchases.
