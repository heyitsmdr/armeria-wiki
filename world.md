# Armeria Universe

**Armeria** is an alternate-reality universe that takes place one-hundred years into the future. Our home planet, [Aluxium](/world/planets/aluxium), is very much like Earth. When you start your adventure in Armeria, you will be welcomed to the universe on our home planet.

Aluxium is a medium-sized planet that has a good mix of cities and industry, alongside an abundance of nature. As you explore the planet, you'll quickly realize that **Armeria Industries (AI)** is behind most of the precious things that we have in this world. Armeria Industries is a mega-corporation that is involved with just about everything. Most people make a living by working for this organization as they are able to provide stable careers in just about every field imaginable.
